This project is a multithreaded server and a graphical client for the game R-\/\+Type, using an engine of our own design.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Dependencies}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
These dependencies can be installed either through vcpkg (see setup instructions later in this R\+E\+A\+D\+ME) or through your local package manager\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+F\+ML
\item Loguru
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Installing vcpkg}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
vcpkg is a submodule of this repository. If you wish to use vcpkg and did not clone this repository with {\ttfamily -\/-\/recurse-\/submodules}, please run {\ttfamily git submodule update -\/-\/init} before continuing.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{Building}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
This project uses C\+Make, allowing it to be built with a large range of compilers.

Generating files for your build system is as simple as executing the following command, from the top directory of this repository\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/B build}
\end{DoxyCode}


without vcpkg, and


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/B build "-\/DCMAKE\_TOOLCHAIN\_FILE=./vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"}
\end{DoxyCode}


if you are using vcpkg (this will automatically install all necessary dependencies).

You can then compile the project with this command (again, from the top directory of this repository)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build build}
\end{DoxyCode}


Once built, the {\ttfamily r-\/type\+\_\+server} and {\ttfamily r-\/type\+\_\+client} executables can be found in the {\ttfamily build} folder.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Other resources}\label{md_README_autotoc_md7}
